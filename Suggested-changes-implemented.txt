Optimizations/Changes Implemented:
Changes in the HTML file, "Agency-Page-Code-Refactor.html"

1. Updated <title> in the <head> of the page to be meaningful and descriptive.
2. Updated <div class="header"> to semantic element <header>
3. Updated <div> holding the nav <ul>/<li>'s to semantic element <nav>
4. Updated the main content div (<div class="content">) to semantic element <main>
5. Updated sub-divs in the main content div to be sections; removed unnecessary classes and condensed styles appropriately.
6. Added missing id for "search-engine-optimization" section nnav functionality.
7. Updated <div class="benefits"> to semantic element <aside>
8. Updated sub-divs in the aside to be sections; removed unnecessary classes and condensed styles appropriately.
9. Updated img tag in the original "benefit-cost" div to remove the unnecessary closing </img> tag thereby mirroring the same format as the other images
10. Wrapped each image in the <main> and <aside> sections in semantic element <figure>
11. Updated the <div class="footer"> to semantic element <footer>
12. Changed the <h2> heading to <h4> to follow natural declining flow of headings
13. Added alt tags to every image on the page except the hero image div 
14. Added title attribute to .hero div for improved accessibility to stand-in for aethetic alt text attribute (since image is set as background-image via CSS and thus without alt text attribute setting at this time in CSS3/HTML5) **See [Stackoverflow: "CSS background image alt attribute"](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/4216035/css-background-image-alt-attribute)** and answer by [@Randy-Greencorn](https://stackoverflow.com/users/1925485/randy-greencorn)

Changes in the CSS file, "style.css"

15. Changed .header class to apply to semantic element "header" instead
16. Updated child h1 as well as span "seo" to parent of "header"
17. Updated .header child ul/li's to apply to "header" and semantic element "nav" instead
18. Updated .content class to semantic element "main" instead
19. Updated .benefits class to semantic element "aside" instead
20. Nested sections in aside and styled in single instance, consolidating and removing the need for separate, identically-styled classes of .benefit-lead/.benefit-brand/.benefit-cost
21. Styled h3 as a standard page element instead of styling as nested in the "aside", since the "aside" held the only instances of h3
22. Styled img in "aside" as single style instance since duplicative styles
23. Styled each section in "main" as a single child style instance since duplicative styles, and removed unnecessary classes of .search-engine-optimization/.online-reputation-management/.social-media-marketing
24. Styled img in "main" as single style instance since duplicative styles
25. Styled h2 as a standard page element instead of styling as nested in the "main", since the "main" held the only instances of h2
26. Changed the .footer class to the semantic element "footer" instead 
27. Changed the "footer" h2 to be h4 instead to follow natural declination of headings
28. Updated order of style elements for global styles first, header second, hero third, and then main section to precede aside section, followed by footer for sake of load-flow, style development best practices, and future specificity as needed/if needed downstream in future updates.
29. Added development comments to explain why certain specificity was retained or removed
30. Added development comments to indicate semantically organized sections of styles for easier downstream review
31. Converted h3 em to px for continuity and downstream comparative edits.
