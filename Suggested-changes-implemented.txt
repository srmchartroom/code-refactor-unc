Suggested Changes Implemented:

Changes in the HTML file, "Agency-Page-Code-Refactor.html"

1. Updated <title> in the <head> of the page to be meaningful and descriptive.
2. Updated <div class="header"> to semantic element <header>
3. Updated <div> holding the nav <ul>/<li>'s to semantic element <nav>
4. Updated the main content div (<div class="content">) to semantic element <main>
5. Updated sub-divs in the main content div to be sections; removed unnecessary classes and condensed styles appropriately.
6. Updated <div class="benefits"> to semantic element <aside>
7. Updated sub-divs in the aside to be sections; removed unnecessary classes and condensed styles appropriately.
8. Updated img tag in the original "benefit-cost" div to remove the unnecessary closing </img> tag thereby mirroring the same format as the other images
6. Wrapped each image in the <main> and <aside> sections in semantic element <figure>
7. Updated the <div class="footer"> to semantic element <footer>
8. Changed the <h2> heading to <h4> to follow natural declining flow of headings

Changes in the CSS file, "style.css"

9. Changed .header class to apply to semantic element "header" instead
10. Updated child h1 as well as span "seo" to parent of "header"
11. Updated .header child ul/li's to apply to "header" and semantic element "nav" instead
12. Updated .content class to semantic element "main" instead
13. Updated .benefits class to semantic element "aside" instead
14. Nested sections in aside and styled in single instance, consolidating and removing the need for separate, identically-styled classes of .benefit-lead/.benefit-brand/.benefit-cost
15. styled h3 as a standard page element instead of styling as nested in the "aside", since the "aside" held the only instances of h3
16. styled img in "aside" as single style instance since duplicative styles
17. styled each section in "main" as a single child style instance since duplicative styles, and removed unnecessary classes of .search-engine-optimization/.online-reputation-management/.social-media-marketing
18. styled img in "main" as single style instance since duplicative styles
19. styled h2 as a standard page element instead of styling as nested in the "main", since the "main" held the only instances of h2
20. Changed the .footer class to the semantic element "footer" instead 
21. Changed the "footer" h2 to be h4 instead to follow natural declination of headings

Changes for accessibility:

22.  Added alt tags to everyimage on the page except the hero image div

***NOTE TO SEAN: must update to keep IDs on the sections since that's how the nav works...
